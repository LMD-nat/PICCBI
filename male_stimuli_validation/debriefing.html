                   <h3><b>What the study was about</b></h3>
                   <p>
                     In this study we are trying to understand people’s judgments about young male's bodies.
                    <br><br>
                    We recently conducted a study with young women and body image, and we found that when we increased the prevalence of thin bodies, women tended to judge bodies as heavier than they did at the beginning of the task.
                   <br><br>
                    We think this might be one way that people begin to internalize a "thin ideal". But because this type of research is usually done with women, we'd like to see if this finding can also be observed in young men.
                   <br><br>
                    The study you've just participated in will help us validate the stimuli for a follow-up study with young men like you. Thanks for your help!
                    <br><br>
                     Once again, we thank you for your participation. If you should want any further information, please contact Sean, Nathalie, or the lab by e-mail at lifespandecisionmakinglab@gmail.com, or Dr. Eppinger at ben.eppinger@concordia.ca
